**music generation**

final project - B.sc software engineer.

In this project we create new music, using neural network. We chose transformer XL as  a model, which solves the fixed-length contexts problem. 
This feature is extremely important in music generation because we wanted to keep the melody's coherence.

In addition we implement the website with Flask library to make our model accessible.
